## Project Overview
This repository is a comprehensive solution for data analysis and machine learning, with a primary focus on breast cancer prediction. It provides a robust pipeline for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and exploratory data analysis (EDA). The project is designed with modularity and scalability in mind, enabling seamless adaptation for other machine learning tasks. It incorporates best practices in software engineering, ensuring maintainability and ease of use for both beginners and advanced users.

## File Structure

### 1. **Datasets**

- **`data/sample_data.csv`**: A smaller dataset provided for testing and demonstration purposes. It allows users to understand the data pipeline without relying on the main dataset.

### 2. **Scripts**
- **`scripts/preprocessing.py`**: Handles data preparation tasks, including:
    - Managing missing values.
    - Normalizing numerical features.
    - Encoding categorical variables.
    - Feature engineering to improve model performance.
- **`scripts/model_training.py`**: Implements machine learning models such as logistic regression, random forests, and others. It includes:
    - Model training and validation.
    - Hyperparameter tuning.
    - Saving trained models for future use.
- **`scripts/evaluation.py`**: Focuses on model performance evaluation by calculating metrics such as:
    - Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
    - Confusion matrices for detailed error analysis.
    - ROC curves and AUC scores for classification performance.

### 3. **Notebooks**

    - Recommendations for the best-performing model.
    - Insights into model strengths and weaknesses.

### 4. **Utilities**
- **`utils/helpers.py`**: A collection of reusable utility functions for:
    - Data loading and preprocessing.
    - Visualization of data and model results.
    - Common tasks to streamline workflows.
- **`utils/constants.py`**: Centralized storage for constants such as:
    - File paths and column names.
    - Default hyperparameter values.
    - Other project-specific settings.

### 5. **Configuration**
- **`config/config.yaml`**: A YAML configuration file for managing project settings, including:
    - File paths for datasets and outputs.
    - Hyperparameters for model training.
    - Options for enabling or disabling specific features.

### 6. **Requirements**
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists all Python dependencies required to run the project, including:
    - `pandas` for data manipulation.
    - `scikit-learn` for machine learning.
    - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualizations.
    - Other libraries essential for the pipeline.
