# README

## Project Overview
This repository is dedicated to various data analysis and machine learning tasks, with a primary focus on breast cancer prediction. It provides a comprehensive pipeline for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, along with detailed exploratory data analysis. The project is structured to ensure modularity and scalability, making it easy to extend and adapt for other machine learning tasks.

## File Structure

### 1. **Datasets**
- `data/breast_cancer.csv`: This dataset is specifically curated for breast cancer prediction. It includes features such as tumor size, texture, perimeter, and diagnosis labels (e.g., benign or malignant). The dataset is used to train and evaluate machine learning models.
- `data/sample_data.csv`: A sample dataset provided for testing and demonstration purposes. It can be used to understand the data pipeline without using the main dataset.

### 2. **Scripts**
- `scripts/preprocessing.py`: This script is responsible for preparing the data for analysis. It includes tasks such as handling missing values, normalizing numerical features, encoding categorical variables, and feature engineering to enhance model performance.
- `scripts/model_training.py`: Contains the implementation of machine learning models, including logistic regression, random forests, and other algorithms. It handles model training, hyperparameter tuning, and saving trained models for later use.
- `scripts/evaluation.py`: Focuses on evaluating the performance of trained models. It calculates metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices to assess the effectiveness of the predictions.

### 3. **Notebooks**
- `notebooks/exploratory_analysis.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook that provides an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the datasets. It includes visualizations, statistical summaries, and insights into the data distribution and relationships between features.
- `notebooks/model_comparison.ipynb`: This notebook compares the performance of different machine learning models on the breast cancer dataset. It includes visualizations of model metrics and recommendations for the best-performing model.

### 4. **Utilities**
- `utils/helpers.py`: A collection of utility functions to streamline tasks such as data loading, visualization, and common preprocessing steps. These functions are designed to be reusable across different scripts and notebooks.
- `utils/constants.py`: Contains constant values such as file paths, column names, and hyperparameter defaults. Centralizing these constants ensures consistency and simplifies updates.

### 5. **Configuration**
- `config/config.yaml`: A configuration file that stores settings for the project, including file paths, hyperparameters, and model options. This allows for easy customization without modifying the codebase.

### 6. **Requirements**
- `requirements.txt`: A list of Python dependencies required to run the project. It includes libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and others.

## Key Features
- **Breast Cancer Prediction**: Implements a machine learning pipeline to predict breast cancer based on input features. The pipeline includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **Modular Codebase**: The project is organized into separate scripts, notebooks, and utility files, making it easy to maintain and extend.
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Provides detailed exploratory data analysis, model training, and performance evaluation to ensure robust predictions.
- **Configurable Workflow**: The use of a configuration file allows users to easily modify settings and adapt the project to new datasets or tasks.
